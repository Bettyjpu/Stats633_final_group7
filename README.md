# Climate Opinion in the U.S.

## Summary

We're interested in exploring how opinions on global warming differs across U.S. states and the political and socioeconomic reasons that cause these differences.

We utilize climate opinion data collected through the Climate Change in the American Mind survey, inlucidng both county-level and state-level data on survey results. Based on survey questions, we visualize data on opinions regarding beliefs, risk perceptions, policy support on a map using Plotly. We implement interactive options using shinyApp.
