## 1. Question
#### What does climate awareness and opinion look like in different states and over time?

- Is high level of awareness/ concern of climate change related to certain demographic features of a state, e.g. income level, education level, etc.?
- As thereâ€™re more extreme climate events, do awareness of climate change increase over time?

#### Why is it important?
- Public opinion about global warming is an important influence on decision making about policies to reduce global warming or prepare for the impacts.
- While researchers find increases in global warming issue importance and perceived harm in different states, policy support increased more in certain states (California and New York) than elsewhere ([Marlon and Wang](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aca702/pdf)).

## 2. Hypothesis

- Higher percentage of residents in coastal states will have direct experience with extreme climate events and global warming, thus more likely to be worried about climate change.

- In states with higher percentage of people with higher education degree, residents are likely to be aware of climate change issues and agree with more policy reforms to tackle climate change issues.

- We would likely observe an increase in climate awareness over the past decade.


## 3. Data

- [Yale Climate Opinion Maps (YCOM), 2010 - 2023](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/)

- [American Community Survey (ACS), 2022](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)

## 3.1 YCOM, 2010 - 2023
- `YCOM` is collected through a national survey and includes data from 2010-2023 for 16 state-level climate opinions.

- The estimates are derived from a large national survey dataset (n>31,000), along with demographic and geographic population characteristics.

- Survey questions include 4 categories: Beliefs, Risk Perceptions, Policy Support, Behaviors.
  - Example question: Do you think that global warming is happening?
  - Multiple choice answers: Yes / No / Don't Know
  - Data is coded as percentage answering *Yes* in a state.

## 3.2 ACS, 2022
- `ACS` is the most comprehensive dataset that covers a wide range of Demographic and Housing Charactersitics including `medium income`, `education level`, etc.
- `ACS` also includes geometry for each state and we used that for mapping.
- With `tidycensus`, we are able to directly select variables of interest and obtain data frames for a specific year.
- The original ACS data is in counts and we standardized them to percentage.
  - Percentage = (Count / Population by ACS)*100
  
## 3.3 Potential Limitations
- The demographic characteristics from the ACS are from the year 2022, and the climate opinion data is also from 2023.
- Both the climate opinion data and ACS data are aggregated estimations that overlook differences among individual states.

## 4. Visualizations
- What is the Relationship Between State-Level Public Opinions on Climate Change Issues (2022) and Demographic Information (2023)? 
  - Shiny app: Map of ACS Demographics and Climate Opinions
- How Do State-Level Extremes in Public Opinion on Climate Change Issues Vary by Year (2010-2023)?
  - Shiny app: dumbbell plot with input year
- What is the Range of Public Opinion on Climate Change Issues Within Specific States Across Multiple Years (2010-2023)?
  - Shiny app: dumbbell plot with input state
